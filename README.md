## Why am I doing this project?

### My goals for this are to learn or produce the following
1. Project management
2. Rebindable controls
3. Learn basics of shader graph
4. Learn basics of Netcode for GameObjects
5. Build more projects for portfolio

I Think that a lot of the material here especially the netcode for gameobjects portion will be very helpful in producing my own unique projects / games in the future.
